If you are seeing this, you probably are a sneaky dev who looked at ASV's Network tab and saw requests
towards this heroku instance. So, why are they here? Well, because their hosting provider, Ignum, is a incompetent
piece of shit that provides an old unsupported version of PHP. The entire ASV backend was written with PHP 8 in mind
and has ALREADY been rewritten from TypeScript (that's a long story... again includes this hosting and some circumstances).
Needless to say, this is getting more complicated, AND I AM NOT REWRITING THIS SHIT AGAIN. So, FUCK IGNUM, fuck cheap
web hosting shit companies.
